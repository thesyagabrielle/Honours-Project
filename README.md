# Patient-Based Real-Time Quality Control (PBRTQC) Dashboard

## Project Overview

This honors project explores how data visualization techniques can enhance anomaly detection in Patient-Based Real-Time Quality Control (PBRTQC) for clinical laboratories. Traditional quality control systems (IQC) are costly and slow in detecting errors. This project evaluates PBRTQC as a cost-effective alternative by visualizing patient results, making it more accessible and actionable for healthcare professionals.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a real-time dashboard for PBRTQC using Microsoft Power BI.
- Enhance error detection accuracy through interactive visualizations of patient samples.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of PBRTQC using control limits and moving averages on test data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Anonymized patient test data collected from Westmead Hospital, comprising patient demographics and test results.

2. **Data Processing**  
   - Preprocessed and handled missing values using SQL Server.

3. **Simulation of Errors**  
   - Simulated constant, proportional, and random errors to assess PBRTQC system effectiveness.

4. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to display control limits and moving averages for real-time anomaly detection.

## Key Skills Developed

- **Data Visualization**  
  Created interactive visualizations using Microsoft Power BI to monitor PBRTQC in real time.

- **SQL & Data Handling**  
  Processed and cleaned large datasets in SQL, including data anonymization, feature engineering, and handling missing values.

- **Statistical Analysis**  
  Applied control limits and moving averages to enhance error detection accuracy.

- **Simulated Error Analysis**  
  Designed and analyzed simulated errors to evaluate PBRTQC effectiveness.

- **Project Management**  
  Coordinated with healthcare professionals and adhered to ethical guidelines for handling sensitive patient data.

## Future Work

- **Machine Learning Integration**  
  Incorporate machine learning algorithms to automate anomaly detection in PBRTQC.

- **Power BI Alerts**  
  Add real-time alert systems for faster identification of outliers.

- **Advanced Statistical Models**  
  Implement models like Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA) for improved accuracy.
